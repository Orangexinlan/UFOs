# UFOs

## Overview of Project
Dana is a data journalist who is at a point in her career where she has the freedom to choose the topics she wants to write about. When she's given the opportunity to write about her hometown McMinnville Oregon, she jumps on it for a couple of reasons. First, it's an opportunity to revisit the memories and people back home. But second and the really fun part, is the topic UFOs. McMinnville is famous for its sightings and even has an annual gathering of UFO enthusiasts. It's a topic that Dana has been interested in since she was a child. When she first heard about farmer Trent's sighting back in 1950. For this assignment, the only thing she has to go on so far is a JavaScript file filled to the brim with sighting information.
Countries, cities, states, type of sighting, there is a lot in this file. Thankfully, Dana is aware of JavaScript's visual functionality. It's a tried and true language after all. Her plan is to first use Javascript to display the data as a table. However, because there is so much data, sifting through it without any adjustments would be a challenge. Dana wants to put everything together in a tidy HTML page. Her article, the table of data to support her findings, and easy to use filters to fine tune the results.

## Results

Ater we refactor the code, the webpage is more clear and easy to use.

In this Index page, you can search by different filters.
  
  1.Filtering by event date
  
  2.Filtering by city
  
  3.Filtering by country
  
  4.Filtering by state 
  
  5.And filtering by shape

The user enters the desired info, the change is detected and the table is updated accordingly. They can always re-initialize the page by clicking on the navbar at the top.

## Summary

#### Drawback
The data is limited, we only have a set amount of data to filter.

#### Recommendation

  1.A button to clear the filters is much needed. The button is better to located below the last filter.
  
  2.We can add a drop-down lists including all filter values in place of the input fields, it would easier fot users to search.
